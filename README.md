# EnOcean over IP

This repository documents the ideas and progress of the EnOcean over IP working group.

## History

In 2017, version [1.0](https://www.enocean-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/EnOcean_Over_IP_Specification_v1.0.pdf) of the *EnOcean over IP Specification* was released.
It describes a JSON representation for specific EEPs, integrated into a REST API for gateways.
As that version was becoming dated, a working group was formed to create a successor.

## Goals

After the first meetings the group confirmed on the following goals:

- Extending the list of specified EEPs
- Decoupling the EEP description from the REST API specification to make it transport layer agnostic
- Confirming on a list of key/value pairs
